# Raspberry Pi for FreeSWITCH Enterprise 

 

## About

There is no big difference in how to install, build or run FreeSWITCH™ on a Raspberry PI except that we have a special Debian repo for that.

## Introduction 

The Raspberry PI usually runs Linux, but because it has another processor architecture, we prepared Debian packages for it in a different repo.

**Easy Way**

## Installing From Debian 10 "Buster" or Debian 9 "Stretch" Packages

### Latest Release Branch:

**Release package**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg2 wget lsb-release software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
USERNAME=FSAUSER
PASSWORD=FSAPASS
wget -O - https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa-rpi/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "machine fsa.freeswitch.com login $USERNAME password $PASSWORD" > /etc/apt/auth.conf
echo "deb https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa-rpi/ `lsb_release -sc` 1.8" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
echo "deb-src https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa-rpi/ `lsb_release -sc` 1.8" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

# you may want to populate /etc/freeswitch at this point.
# if /etc/freeswitch does not exist, the standard vanilla configuration is deployed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y freeswitch-meta-all
```

FreeSWITCH™ is now installed and can be accessed with

**FreeSwitch CLI**

```bash
fs_cli -rRS
```

Dev Branch ("git"):

WARNING not suitable for production

**Master Test Package**

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg2 wget lsb-release software-properties-common apt-transport-https 
USERNAME=FSAUSER
PASSWORD=FSAPASS
wget -O - https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa-rpi/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "machine fsa.freeswitch.com login $USERNAME password $PASSWORD" > /etc/apt/auth.conf
echo "deb https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa-rpi/ `lsb_release -sc` unstable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list
echo "deb-src https://fsa.freeswitch.com/repo/deb/fsa-rpi/ `lsb_release -sc` unstable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freeswitch.list

# you may want to populate /etc/freeswitch at this point.
# if /etc/freeswitch does not exist, the standard vanilla configuration is deployed
apt-get update && apt-get install -y freeswitch-meta-all
```
